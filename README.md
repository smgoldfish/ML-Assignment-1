## Project Overview
In this project, we aim to build a regression model to predict  CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from vehicles based on various attributes. A dataset which provides detailed information on vehicle characteristics like engine size, cylinder count, and fuel consumption was sourced from Kaggle. An effort has been made to explore the relationship between these attributes and the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.

To achieve this, we implemented four regression models: Ridge, Random Forest, Decision Tree and Linear Regression. Each model is trained to predict the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, and their performance is evaluated using multiple metrics like MAPE, MSE, MAE and R<sup>2</sup>.
